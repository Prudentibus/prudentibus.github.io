Create a new HTML page for the Prudentibus GitHub Pages site.

Follow these steps:
1. Ask the user for the page name and purpose
2. Create the HTML file in the root directory
3. Use the purple gradient theme from index.html as the design base
4. Include responsive design (mobile viewport meta tag)
5. Add appropriate semantic HTML and accessibility features
6. Keep CSS/JS inline unless the page is very complex
7. Commit with message format: "feat: Add [page-name] page"
8. Ask if they want to link it from index.html

Design requirements:
- 4-space indentation
- Modern, clean aesthetic
- Retro touches are welcome (like calculator.html)
- Include at least one subtle Easter egg if appropriate

After creating the page, provide:
- File path
- Instructions for accessing it once deployed
- Suggested next steps
